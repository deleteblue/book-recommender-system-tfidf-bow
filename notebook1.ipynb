    "<p>Charles Darwin is one of the few universal figures of science. His most renowned work is without a doubt his \"<em>On the Origin of Species</em>\" published in 1859 which introduced the concept of natural selection. But Darwin wrote many other books on a wide range of topics, including geology, plants or his personal life. In this notebook, we will automatically detect how closely related his books are to each other.</p>\n",
    "<p>To this purpose, we will develop the bases of <strong>a content-based book recommendation system</strong>, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are. The methods we will use are commonly used in text- or documents-heavy industries such as legal, tech or customer support to perform some common task such as text classification or handling search engine queries.</p>\n",

    "## 12. Which books have similar content?\n",
    "<p>This turns out to be extremely useful if we want to determine a given book's most similar work. For example, we have just seen that if you enjoyed \"<em>On the Origin of Species</em>,\" you can read books discussing similar concepts such as \"<em>The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</em>\" or \"<em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em>.\" If you are familiar with Darwin's work, these suggestions will likely seem natural to you. Indeed, <em>On the Origin of Species</em> has a whole chapter about domestication and <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em> applies the theory of natural selection to human evolution. Hence, the results make sense.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, we now want to have a better understanding of the big picture and see how Darwin's books are generally related to each other (in terms of topics discussed). To this purpose, we will represent the whole similarity matrix as a dendrogram, which is a standard tool to display such data. <strong>This last approach will display all the information about book similarities at once.</strong> For example, we can find a book's closest relative but, also, we can visualize which groups of books have similar topics (e.g., the cluster about Charles Darwin personal life with his autobiography and letters). If you are familiar with Darwin's bibliography, the results should not surprise you too much, which indicates the method gives good results. Otherwise, next time you read one of the author's book, you will know which other books to read next in order to learn more about the topics it addressed.</p>"
